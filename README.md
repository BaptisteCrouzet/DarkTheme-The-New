**Dark Theme - The New** is a sleek and modern dark theme for Visual Studio Code.
It's been crafted with a keen eye for detail to provide a comfortable and delightful coding experience. This theme is perfect for those late-night coding sessions, and for anyone who prefers a darker, more muted color palette.

## Features ðŸŒŸ

- A carefully curated color palette that's easy on the eyes. The dominant touch of **dark purple** throughout the theme provides a soothing and cohesive visual experience.
- Distinct colors for **additions, deletions, and modifications, making diff reading a breeze**. This is particularly useful for developers who work with Git and other version control systems on a regular basis.
- Excellent text readability across various widgets and status bars. I've ensured that every piece of text, whether it's in the editor or in a widget, is clear and easy to read.
- Special attention to **Git-related activities and error highlighting** just because it's important to quickly spot changes and errors in your code, so these aspects stand out.
